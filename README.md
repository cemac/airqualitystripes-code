# AirQualityStripes
Code repo for the Air Quality Stripes project https://airqualitystripes.info/ 

Data is available here:  https://zenodo.org/records/13361899

The Air Quality Stripes project plots outdoor particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations for cities around the world as a series of bar charts with distinctive "stripes" to show the concentration.

Any questions? Contact: airqualitystripes@gmail.com

The project is a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh (EPCC), the University of Leeds (School of Earth and Environment), the Software Sustainability Institute, the UK Met Office and North Carolina State University.

**Code Summary (10/12/2024)**

**List_of_Cities_Continent.txt**
- Contains the list of cities and lat / lon for the cities considered in V1.6
  

**plotting_routines_cities.py**  
- Python code that contains a number of plotting functions to produce the plots, all with a similar format.

  e.g. plot_absolute_bar_plot(data_combined, years, custom_cmap, plot_title, continent) 
  
    - data_combined = data to plot (produced in Loop_Over_Cities.ipyn)
    - years = years to plot (x axis)
    - custom_cmap = colour scheme used (produced in Loop_Over_Cities.ipyn)
    - plot_title = city and country name 
    - continent = continent category

**Loop_Over_Cities.ipynb**

Input files
 - cmip_annual_mean_output.nc: Contains modeled PM2.5 concentrations (1850-2014).
 - vand_annual_mean_output.nc: Contains satellite-observed PM2.5 concentrations (1998-2022).
 - List_of_Cities_Continent.txt: A text file with metadata for each city, including: Latitude (lat), Longitude (lon), Continent (continent)

Workflow

1) Load Datasets:
   - Reads NetCDF files for model and satellite data.
   - Loads city metadata into a dictionary.

2) Process Each City in a Loop:

   - Interpolates model data (CMIP) to the city's latitude and longitude using linear interpolation.
   - Selects the nearest satellite data (VAND) for the city's location.
   - Averages model and satellite data over a specified time period (e.g., 2000–2002).

   Calculates the ratio of satellite to model data and classifies uncertainty as:
   - Low Uncertainty (ratio < 2)
   - Moderate Uncertainty (2 ≤ ratio < 4)
   - High Uncertainty (ratio ≥ 4)

   Combines model and satellite data into a single time series:
   - Uses weighted model data for years before 2000.
   - Uses satellite data for years from 2001 onward.
  
3) Visualization:

   - Generates time-series plots for each city in four different formats
   - Also generates plot comparing model and sattellite data (on Zenodo) for each city

4) Output Generation:

   - Saves individual city plots as PNG files in the output directory.
   - Data_Cities_F1_V1pt6.xlsx: A wide-format dataset with annual PM2.5 values for all cities.
   - Cities_Data_Ratios.xlsx: Ratio of the  3 year mean satellitte to 3 year mean model value for each city.
